# Smart-Rockets
 An implementation of the NEAT algorythm playing a "replica" of the old atari game "Lunar Lander".  The code is commented and it was made more to be a POC than to be a full fledged project, and I'm quite happy with the result. The picke part is currently giving me some trouble, but I'm sure that I can fix it later.
