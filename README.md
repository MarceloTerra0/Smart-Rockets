# Smart-Rockets
 An implementation of the NEAT algorythm playing a "replica" of the old atari game "Lunar Lander" made with "neat-python", the players (AI) need to land on the ground with a correct angle, ySpeed and xSpeed, and it tries to perfect the game (And even exploiting the game's points system!).
 
The main code is fully commented (excluding most of pygame's functions & Class/Object creation) and it was made more to be a POC than to be a full fledged project, and I'm quite happy with the result.
